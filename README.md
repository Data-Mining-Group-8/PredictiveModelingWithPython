Predictive modeling with Python 
===============================

An implementation of a predictive modeling approach based on the decision tree algorithm.
In this project, we will implement and evaluate this approach on two datasets [Wine](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)
and [Vetebral column](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/vertebral+column)
